Here’s a **comprehensive list of interview questions** covering **Chapter 15: Source Files and Programs** from *The C++ Programming Language (4th Edition)* by **Bjarne Stroustrup**. These are categorized by **difficulty level** and include **detailed answers**.

# **Beginner-Level Questions**  

### **1. What is separate compilation in C++? Why is it useful?**  
#### **Answer:**  
Separate compilation allows **different parts of a program** to be compiled independently and then linked together. This approach:  
✅ **Reduces compilation time** (only modified files are recompiled).  
✅ **Enables modular programming** (different teams can work on separate modules).  
✅ **Promotes code reuse** (functions and classes can be shared).  

---

### **2. What is the difference between a header file (`.h`) and an implementation file (`.cpp`)?**  
#### **Answer:**  
- **Header files (`.h`)**: Contain **declarations** (function prototypes, class definitions, macros, constants).  
- **Implementation files (`.cpp`)**: Contain **definitions** (actual code for functions and classes).  

Example:  
```cpp
// mymath.h (Header File)
#ifndef MYMATH_H
#define MYMATH_H
int add(int, int);
#endif
```
```cpp
// mymath.cpp (Implementation File)
#include "mymath.h"
int add(int a, int b) { return a + b; }
```

---

### **3. What is the purpose of `#include` in C++?**  
#### **Answer:**  
`#include` **inserts the content of a file into another file** before compilation.  

Example:  
```cpp
#include <iostream>  // Includes standard library
#include "mymath.h"  // Includes user-defined header
```
Without `#include`, functions or classes from external files **would not be accessible**.

---

### **4. What are include guards? Why are they necessary?**  
#### **Answer:**  
Include guards **prevent multiple inclusions of the same header file**, avoiding redefinition errors.  

Example:  
```cpp
#ifndef HEADER_FILE_H
#define HEADER_FILE_H
// Header file content
#endif
```
Without include guards, including the same file multiple times causes errors.

---

### **5. What is `#pragma once`? How is it different from include guards?**  
#### **Answer:**  
`#pragma once` is a **compiler directive** that ensures a header file is included only once.  

Example:  
```cpp
#pragma once
// Header content
```
It is simpler than include guards but **not part of the official C++ standard** (though widely supported).

---

# **Intermediate-Level Questions**  

### **6. What is linkage in C++? What are its types?**  
#### **Answer:**  
Linkage determines **how identifiers (variables, functions) are accessed across translation units**.  

- **External linkage** (default): Symbols **can be used in other files**.  
- **Internal linkage**: Symbols **are limited to the file they are defined in**.  

---

### **7. What is the difference between `static` and `extern` in terms of linkage?**  
#### **Answer:**  
| Keyword  | Effect |
|----------|--------|
| `static` | Restricts visibility to the file (internal linkage). |
| `extern` | Allows visibility across multiple files (external linkage). |

Example:  
```cpp
// file1.cpp
static int hiddenVar = 10;  // Only accessible in this file

// file2.cpp
extern int sharedVar;  // Defined in another file
```

---

### **8. How do you declare and use an `extern` variable in multiple files?**  
#### **Answer:**  
✅ **Declaration** (without definition) in a header file:  
```cpp
// globals.h
extern int globalVar;
```
✅ **Definition** in one source file:  
```cpp
// file1.cpp
#include "globals.h"
int globalVar = 100;
```
✅ **Usage** in another source file:  
```cpp
// file2.cpp
#include "globals.h"
std::cout << globalVar;  // Accesses the global variable
```
This **prevents multiple definitions** while allowing shared access.

---

### **9. What happens if multiple files define the same global variable without `extern`?**  
#### **Answer:**  
Each file gets **its own separate copy**, leading to **multiple definition errors** during linking.  
Example (**incorrect** usage):  
```cpp
// file1.cpp
int myVar = 10;  // Definition

// file2.cpp
int myVar = 20;  // Another definition (error at link time)
```
Fix: Use **`extern`** in the header file.

---

### **10. What are forward declarations? Why are they useful?**  
#### **Answer:**  
A **forward declaration** introduces a name **without defining it**.  
Useful for **avoiding unnecessary header file dependencies**.

Example:  
```cpp
class MyClass;  // Forward declaration
void function(MyClass* obj);  // Function prototype using the class
```
This speeds up compilation by **preventing unnecessary header inclusions**.

---

# **Advanced-Level Questions**  

### **11. What is the initialization order of global/static objects across multiple files?**  
#### **Answer:**  
- The **initialization order of static/global objects across files is undefined**.  
- This can lead to the **static initialization order problem**.  

Example:  
```cpp
// file1.cpp
extern int value;
int useValue = value;  // Undefined behavior if value is not initialized yet

// file2.cpp
int value = 10;
```
A **solution** is the **Construct On First Use idiom** (using functions to return static objects).

---

### **12. How does the compiler handle function definitions found in multiple `.cpp` files?**  
#### **Answer:**  
If a **function is defined in multiple `.cpp` files**, the **linker throws an error** due to multiple definitions.  
Fix: Move function declaration to a header file and define it in only one `.cpp` file.

Example (Correct Usage):  
```cpp
// header.h
void myFunction();

// file1.cpp
#include "header.h"
void myFunction() { std::cout << "Hello"; }

// file2.cpp
#include "header.h"
myFunction();  // Works fine
```

---

### **13. What are translation units in C++?**  
#### **Answer:**  
A **translation unit** is the output of the **preprocessor stage**.  
- **Each `.cpp` file + included headers = One translation unit**.  
- **Each unit is compiled separately** and linked later.  

---

### **14. What happens if a destructor of a global/static object throws an exception?**  
#### **Answer:**  
- If an exception **escapes from a global/static object's destructor**, the program **terminates immediately** (`std::terminate()` is called).  
- Always **catch exceptions in destructors** to avoid program crashes.  

Example:  
```cpp
class MyClass {
public:
    ~MyClass() {
        try { throw std::runtime_error("Error"); }
        catch (...) { std::cout << "Handled exception"; }
    }
};
```

---

### **15. How can circular dependencies between header files be avoided?**  
#### **Answer:**  
Circular dependencies occur when **two header files include each other**.  
Solution: Use **forward declarations** instead of including headers in headers.

✅ **Correct Usage**:  
```cpp
// A.h
class B;  // Forward declaration

class A {
    B* b;  // Pointer to B (no need to include B.h)
};
```
This **reduces unnecessary dependencies and speeds up compilation**.

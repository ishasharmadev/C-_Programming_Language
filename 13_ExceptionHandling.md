You're right! Chapter 13 of *The C++ Programming Language (4th Edition)* is about **Exception Handling**. Hereâ€™s a structured breakdown of the chapter, following its headings and subheadings:

---

# **Chapter 13: Exception Handling**

## **13.1 Exceptions**
An **exception** is an error condition that interrupts normal execution. C++ provides exception-handling mechanisms to deal with such situations in a structured way.

- **13.1.1 The Idea of Exception Handling**  
  - Allows separating error-handling code from normal logic.
  - Helps make programs more readable and maintainable.

- **13.1.2 Throwing an Exception (`throw`)**  
  - Exceptions are triggered using the `throw` keyword.  
  - Example:
    ```cpp
    void divide(int a, int b) {
        if (b == 0) throw std::runtime_error("Division by zero");
        std::cout << "Result: " << (a / b) << '\n';
    }
    ```
  
- **13.1.3 Catching an Exception (`try` and `catch`)**  
  - Code that might throw exceptions should be placed inside a `try` block.  
  - `catch` blocks handle specific exception types.
  - Example:
    ```cpp
    try {
        divide(10, 0);
    } catch (const std::runtime_error& e) {
        std::cerr << "Error: " << e.what() << '\n';
    }
    ```

- **13.1.4 Rethrowing Exceptions**  
  - An exception can be caught and rethrown using `throw;` inside a `catch` block.
  - Useful when handling needs to be deferred to a higher level.

## **13.2 Exception Hierarchy**
C++ uses a hierarchy of exception types:

- **13.2.1 Standard Exception Classes**  
  - C++ provides built-in exception classes in `<stdexcept>`, such as:
    - `std::exception` (base class)
    - `std::runtime_error`
    - `std::logic_error`
    - `std::out_of_range`
    - `std::bad_alloc`
  
- **13.2.2 User-Defined Exception Classes**  
  - Custom exception classes can be created by inheriting from `std::exception`:
    ```cpp
    class MyException : public std::exception {
    public:
        const char* what() const noexcept override {
            return "Custom exception occurred";
        }
    };
    ```

## **13.3 Resource Management and Exceptions**
Managing resources properly in exception-handling contexts.

- **13.3.1 Resource Cleanup with `finally` (RAII)**  
  - Unlike some languages, C++ does not have a `finally` block. Instead, it uses RAII (Resource Acquisition Is Initialization).
  - Example:
    ```cpp
    class FileHandler {
        std::fstream file;
    public:
        FileHandler(const std::string& filename) { file.open(filename); }
        ~FileHandler() { file.close(); } // Ensures cleanup
    };
    ```

- **13.3.2 Stack Unwinding**  
  - When an exception is thrown, C++ automatically destroys local objects as it unwinds the stack.

- **13.3.3 Avoiding Memory Leaks**  
  - Use smart pointers (`std::unique_ptr`, `std::shared_ptr`) instead of raw pointers to prevent leaks.

## **13.4 Exception Safety**
- **13.4.1 Basic Guarantee**: No resource leaks, but program state may be inconsistent.
- **13.4.2 Strong Guarantee**: Either the operation succeeds, or nothing changes.
- **13.4.3 No-Throw Guarantee**: Operation is guaranteed not to throw.

## **13.5 Best Practices**
- Use `std::exception` hierarchy for consistency.
- Avoid catching exceptions by non-const reference (`catch (std::exception&)`).
- Use RAII to manage resources.
- Prefer standard exceptions over custom ones unless necessary.
